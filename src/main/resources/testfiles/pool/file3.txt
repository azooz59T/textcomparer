Montcalm speaks with Munro, again saying that the British have been overwhelmed by French forces. Munro, indignant, replies that Webb will be sending reinforcements from Fort Edward, but Montcalm, now quite proud, shows Heyward and Munro a letter, intercepted from the British and signed by Webb, stating that Webb considers Fort William Henry to be lost, and that, therefore, Webb will send no reinforcements. Munro is crushed by this news, and he realizes that he will have to abandon the fort to the French. He leaves Montcalm, dejected, and allows Heyward to arrange the truce with Montcalm; Montcalm promises that the British and their dependents in the fort will be allowed safe and orderly passage through enemy lines to their own (British) territory, after the hand-over of the fort is accomplished.

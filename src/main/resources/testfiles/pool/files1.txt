Alice and Cora then thank Heyward, in seriousness, for his efforts in saving them thus far, and Cora goes on to say that she worries about her father Munro’s health and reputation should he French defeat the English in the siege and take over Fort William Henry. The group wonders if Webb will send reinforcements to Fort William Henry from Fort Edward, although it appears less and less likely with each passing day. Heyward thanks Alice and Cora for their visit, but says he must meet with Munro to decide on strategy for the remainder of the siege.
Munro meets with Heyward, telling him that Hawkeye has passed through enemy lines and been released by Montcalm back into the English fort, with news from Webb that, in fact, no reinforcements will be sent to Fort William Henry. Munro states that the fort has very few options, and that Montcalm has requested that Munro speak with him outside the fort, in the French camp. Munro asks Heyward whether Heyward would mind meeting with Montcalm first, and Heyward replies that it would be his honor. Heyward passes out of the fort, under a sign of temporary truce, and meets with Montcalm, surrounded by French soldiers, in the nearby French line—he is greeted courteously by Montcalm, who prides himself on his “noble” carriage in battle.

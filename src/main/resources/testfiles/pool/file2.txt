Munro’s first wife, however, then died in the West Indies, and he and Cora moved back to Scotland, where Munro found that Alice Graham had waited for him for twenty years—Munro then married Graham, and had another child, Alice. Thus Cora and Alice are half-sisters, and the differences in their temperaments and hair colors are explained by their different mothers. Munro intimates that he has a particular relationship to Alice because she is the only daughter of his beloved Alice Graham, whose patience Munro has come to idealize over the ensuing years (Alice Graham also passed away, when Alice the daughter was young).

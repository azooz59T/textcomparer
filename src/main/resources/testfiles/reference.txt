Hawkeye says they have two options for proceeding to the fort: they can send the Mohicans ahead, to kill Frenchmen in the fashion so demonstrated by Chingachgook, allowing the band to follow; or the whole band can travel along a high ledge, rimming the forest, and enter the fort from the opposing side. Heyward agrees to the latter, and Hawkeye says this course is probably more prudent, although the former would be more “manful.”
One gets the sense that, although Hawkeye is more than willing to use his cunning to combat Magua and carry Heyward and the band to safety, he relishes a good fight, and feels that, in this case, he is giving up one in order to preserve the band’s safety.

The group moves up the incline, out of the forest valleys, and onto a narrow path on the edge of a ridge, on which they rise for nearly a thousand feet. At this point, Hawkeye points out that the southern shore of Lake George is visible, and that the group will need to abandon its horses here, since they will not fit on the path ahead. The band moves on to a clearing, from which they see Fort William Henry, spread below, and a large group of thousands of French soldiers, who are midway through a siege of that fort, under Montcalm’s command. Hawkeye remarks that the French will continue their shelling of the fort, which is so far holding out under the French attack, until the fog that is rolling in covers the southern end of the lake, and makes the shelling impossible.
